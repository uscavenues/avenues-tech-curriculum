From pitch to portfolio: scaffold for your capstone website project!

This is your **starter repo** — you’ll use it for every lesson, building toward your final capstone website.

# Personal Website Capstone Template

Welcome! This repo is your starting point for Tech Curriculum.  
Over 6 lessons, you will build a **portfolio/personal website** you can share on LinkedIn or wherever you like!  

# Structure
- `/src` → Your website’s HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- `/docs` → Documentation (pitch + assignment notes)  

# Lessons
1. GitHub Setup + Capstone Pitch (`/docs/pitch.md`)  
2. HTML Basics (`/src/index.html`)  
3. CSS Styling (`/src/styles.css`)  
4. JavaScript Interactivity (`/src/js/main.js`)  
5. Live API Integration (`/docs/api-notes.md`, add `live.html`)  

# Final Capstone
By the end, you’ll have a functional personal website with:
- Responsive design  
- At least one interactive feature  
- One live API integration
